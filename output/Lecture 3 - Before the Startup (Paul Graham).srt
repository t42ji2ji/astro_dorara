1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,919
That short, like long introductions are no good.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,120
Sam knows, all right, ready everybody?

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,240
I'm not gonna ask if the mic is working like in every talk so far.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,559
I'll just assume it's working.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm just, no, fuck.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,160
All right, well, make it work, somebody.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
It works, it works.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,480
All right, all right.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,280
This is like some kind of class tradition.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,039
All right, all right.

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,100
I wrote out my talk and afterwards in a couple days I will like turn it from a talk

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,359
into an essay and put it online so you don't have to take notes.

13
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,520
Just, just listen.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,980
All right, so one of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,579
advice to people you can ask yourself, what would I tell my own kids?

16
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,200
And actually you find this really focuses you.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,660
So even though my kids are little, my two year old today,

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,200
when asked what he was gonna be after two, said a bat.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,180
The correct answer was three, but a bat is so much more interesting.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
So even though my kids are little, I already know what I would tell them

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,640
about startups if they were in college.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,420
And so that is what I'm going to tell you.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
So you're literally getting what I would give my own kids, since most of you are

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,000
young enough to be my own kids.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
All right, so startups are very counterintuitive.

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,019
And I'm not sure exactly why.

27
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,620
It could be simply because knowledge about them has not permeated our culture yet.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,260
But whatever the reason, this is an area where you cannot trust your intuitions all

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,140
the time.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,920
It's like skiing in that way.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Any of you guys learn to ski as adults?

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,700
You know, when you're skiing, when you first try skiing and you wanna slow down,

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,599
your first impulse is to lean back, just like in everything else.

34
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,219
But lean back on skis and you fly down the hill out of control.

35
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,500
So, as I learned.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,819
So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.

37
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,240
Eventually you get new habits.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,700
But in the beginning, there's this list of things you're trying to remember as you

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,659
start down the hill.

40
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:11,819
You know, like alternate feet, make S turns, do not drag the inside foot, all this stuff.

41
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,939
Well, startups are as unnatural as skiing.

42
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,819
And there is a similar list of stuff you have to remember for startups.

43
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,459
And what I'm gonna give you today is the beginning of the list.

44
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,879
The list of the counterintuitive stuff you have to remember to like prevent your

45
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
existing instincts from leading you astray.

46
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,259
The first thing on it is the fact I just mentioned that startups are so

47
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,099
weird that if you follow your instincts, they will lead you astray.

48
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,759
If you remember nothing more than that, when you're about to make a mistake,

49
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,599
you may at least pause before making it.

50
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,379
When I was running Y Combinator, we used to joke that our function was to

51
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,319
tell founders things they would ignore.

52
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,719
And it's really true.

53
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,259
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes they are about to

54
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,099
make, and the founders ignore them.

55
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,479
And they come back a year later and say, I wish we'd listened.

56
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,159
But that dude is in their cap table, there's nothing they can do.

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,539
Why do founders persistently ignore the partner's advice?

58
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:17,280
Well, that's the thing about counterintuitive ideas.

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,259
They contradict your intuitions.

60
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:22,179
So, they seem wrong.

61
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:25,560
So of course, your first impulse is to ignore them.

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,079
And in fact, that is not just the curse of Y Combinator, but

63
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,359
to some extent, our raison d'etre.

64
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,019
You don't need people to give you advice that doesn't surprise you, right?

65
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,799
If founders' existing intuitions gave them the right answers,

66
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,259
they wouldn't need us.

67
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,219
That's why there are a lot of ski instructors and

68
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,340
not many running instructors, right?

69
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,539
Like that, you don't see those two words together, running instructor,

70
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,560
as much as you see ski instructor.

71
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,699
It's because skiing is counterintuitive.

72
00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:00,299
So it's sort of what YC is, is like business ski instructors,

73
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,579
except for going up slopes instead of down them.

74
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,180
Well, ideally.

75
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,500
You can, however, trust your instincts about people.

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,539
You, your life so far hasn't been much like starting a startup, but

77
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,439
all the interactions you've had with people are just like the interactions you

78
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,000
have with people in the business world.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,219
So in fact, one of the big mistakes that founders make is not to trust their

80
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,259
intuitions about people enough.

81
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,300
They meet someone who seems impressive, but

82
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,540
about whom they feel some misgivings.

83
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,060
And then later, when things blow up, they tell them, they say, you know,

84
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,319
I knew there was something wrong about that guy, but

85
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,779
I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.

86
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:46,259
And there's this, a specific sub case in business, especially if you had come from

87
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,019
an engineering background, as I believe you all do.

88
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,179
You think business is supposed to be this sort of slightly distasteful thing.

89
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:57,759
And so when you meet people who seem smart, but somehow distasteful, you think, well,

90
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,559
okay, this must be normal for business.

91
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,039
But it's not.

92
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,979
Just like pick people the way you would pick people if you were picking friends.

93
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,620
This is one of those rare cases where it works to be self-indulgent.

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,980
Work with people you genuinely like and respect, and

95
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,280
that you have known long enough to be sure.

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,660
Because there's a lot of people who are really good at seeming likable for a while.

97
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,660
Just wait until your interests are opposed, and then you'll see.

98
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,319
All right.

99
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,240
The second counterintuitive point is that, and

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,620
this might come as a little bit of a disappointment.

101
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:39,060
But what you need to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups.

102
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,740
That makes this class different from most other classes you take.

103
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,620
If you take a French class, at the end of it,

104
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,800
you will learn how to speak French if you do the work.

105
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,620
You may not sound exactly like a French person, but pretty close, right?

106
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,319
This class can teach you about startups, but that is not what you need to know.

107
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,600
What you need to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups,

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,080
what you need is expertise in your own users.

109
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,820
Mark Zuckerberg did not succeed in Facebook because he was an expert in startups.

110
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,980
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups.

111
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,439
I mean, Facebook was first incorporated as a Florida LLC.

112
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,560
Right?

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
Even you guys know better than that.

114
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,780
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups,

115
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,599
because he understood his users very well.

116
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:36,159
Most of you don't know the mechanics of raising an angel around, right?

117
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,959
And if you feel bad about that, don't.

118
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,059
Because I can tell you,

119
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,519
Mark Zuckerberg probably doesn't know the mechanics of raising an angel around either.

120
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,259
If he was even paying attention when Ron Conway wrote him the big check,

121
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,139
he has probably forgotten about it by now.

122
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,159
In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary for people to learn in detail about the mechanics

123
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,060
of starting a startup, but possibly somewhat dangerous.

124
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,259
Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders starting startups is to go

125
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,300
through the motions of starting a startup.

126
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,439
They come up with some plausible sounding idea.

127
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,079
They raise funding at a nice valuation.

128
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,579
They rent a nice office in Soma.

129
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,539
Hire a bunch of their friends.

130
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:27,219
And then the next step after rent a nice office in Soma and

131
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:32,120
hire a bunch of their friends is gradually realize how completely fucked they are.

132
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,519
Because while imitating all the outward forms of starting a startup,

133
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,019
they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential,

134
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,139
which is to make something people want.

135
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,860
By the way, that's the only use of that swear word except for

136
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,639
the initial one that was involuntary.

137
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,639
And I did check with Sam whether it would be okay.

138
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,199
He said he had done it several times.

139
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,279
I mean, use the word.

140
00:07:53,279 --> 00:08:05,680
We saw this happen so often.

141
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,279
No, I mean people going through the motions of starting a startup.

142
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:16,039
That we made up a name for it, Playing House.

143
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:19,719
Eventually, I realized why it was happening.

144
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,619
The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is

145
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,519
because that is what they have been trained to do for

146
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,319
their whole lives up to this point.

147
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,379
Think about what it takes to get into college.

148
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,279
Extra curricular activities, check, right?

149
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:43,240
Even in college classes, most of the work you do is as artificial as running laps.

150
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,240
And I am not attacking the educational system for being this way.

151
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,299
Inevitably, the work that you do to learn something is gonna have some amount of

152
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,259
fakeness to it.

153
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,139
And if you measure people's performance, they will inevitably exploit the difference

154
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:01,459
to the degree that what you're measuring is largely an artifact of the fakeness.

155
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,820
And I confess that I did this myself in college.

156
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,580
In fact, here's a useful tip on getting good grades.

157
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,080
I found that in a lot of classes, there might only be 20 or

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,080
30 ideas that actually had the right shape to make good exam questions.

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,600
And so the way I studied for exams in these classes was not to master the material in

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,240
the class, but to try and figure out what the exam questions would be and

161
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,180
work out the answers in advance.

162
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,120
And like, for me, the test was not like what my answers would be on the exam.

163
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,879
For me, the test was which of my exam questions would turn up on the exam, right?

164
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,080
So I would get my grade instantly.

165
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,159
I would walk into the exam and look at the questions and

166
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,019
see how many I got right, essentially.

167
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,759
It works in a lot of classes, especially CS classes.

168
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,500
I remember automata theory.

169
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,440
There's only a few things that make sense to ask about automata theory.

170
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,320
So it's not surprising that after being effectively trained for

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,379
their whole lives to play such games, young founders first impulse on starting

172
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:03,180
a startup is to figure out what the tricks are for this new game.

173
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,760
What are the extracurricular activities of startups?

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,740
What are the things I have to do?

175
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
They always want to know.

176
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,379
Since, since apparently the measure of success for

177
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,760
a startup is fundraising, another noob mistake.

178
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,300
They always want to know what are the tricks for convincing investors?

179
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:24,199
And we have to tell them the best way to convince investors is to start a startup

180
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:29,199
that's actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so.

181
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:34,639
So then they ask, okay, what are the tricks for growing fast, right?

182
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,759
And this is exacerbated by the existence of this term, growth hacks, right?

183
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,199
Whenever you hear anybody talk about growth hacks,

184
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:45,579
just mentally translate it in your mind into bullshit.

185
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,940
Because what we tell them is the way to make your startup grow is to make

186
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,340
something that users really love, right?

187
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,460
And then tell them about it.

188
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,639
So that's what you have to do.

189
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,100
That's growth hacks right there.

190
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,860
So, so many of the conversations the YC partners have with the founders begin with

191
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,139
the founders saying a sentence that begins with how do I?

192
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:13,900
And the partners answering with a sentence that begins with just, right?

193
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,519
Why do they make things so complicated?

194
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,740
The reason I realized after years of being puzzled by this is they're looking for the trick.

195
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,939
They've been trained to look for the trick.

196
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:28,500
So this is the third thing, the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups.

197
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,319
Starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working.

198
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:36,899
Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company.

199
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,840
Depending on how broken the company is, you may be able to succeed by sucking up to the right

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,600
person, giving the impression of productivity by sending emails late at night.

201
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,060
Or if you're smart enough, changing the clock on your computer.

202
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,680
Cuz who's gonna check the headers, right?

203
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,460
But I like an audience that I can tell jokes like that too and they laugh.

204
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,899
Over in the business school, headers?

205
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,899
Okay.

206
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,039
God, this thing is being recorded.

207
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,579
I just realized that.

208
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:18,019
All right, from now on we are sticking strictly to the script.

209
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,899
All right.

210
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,720
But in startups, that does not work.

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,139
There is no boss to trick.

212
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,000
There's no, how can you trick people if there's no one to trick?

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,360
There's only users and all users care about is that,

214
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,320
is whether your software does what they want, right?

215
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,500
They're like sharks.

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,100
Sharks are like too stupid to fool.

217
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,259
You can't like wave a red flag at a shark and fool it.

218
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,440
It's like meat or no meat.

219
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,440
So you have to have something that people want and

220
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,320
you only prosper to the extent that you do.

221
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,159
The dangerous thing is, particularly for you guys,

222
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,299
the dangerous thing is that faking does work to some extent with investors.

223
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,159
You, if you're really good at knowing what you're talking about,

224
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,839
you can fool investors for one, maybe two rounds of funding.

225
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,539
But it's not in your interest to.

226
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,639
I mean, you're all doing this for equity.

227
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,000
You're playing a confidence trick on yourself.

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,819
You're wasting your own time because the startup is doomed.

229
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:15,579
And all you're doing is you're just gonna waste your time writing it down.

230
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,779
So stop looking for the trick.

231
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,359
There are tricks in startups as there are in any domain, but

232
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:25,259
they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem.

233
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,039
Someone who knows zero about fundraising but

234
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,500
has made something users really love will have an easier time raising money

235
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,759
than someone who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph.

236
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:41,659
Though in a sense, it's bad news that gaming the startup stops works.

237
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,879
Gaming the system stops working now.

238
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,059
In the sense that you're deprived of one of your most powerful weapons and

239
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,419
after all something you've spent 20 years mastering.

240
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,819
It is something I find it very exciting.

241
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,039
That there even exist parts of the world where gaming the system is not how you win.

242
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,419
I would have been really excited in college if I had explicitly realized that

243
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,779
there are parts of the world where gaming the system matters less than others.

244
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,879
And some where it hardly matters at all.

245
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,439
But there are.

246
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,340
And this is one of the most important things to think about when you're planning your future.

247
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,560
Got that?

248
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,340
Okay.

249
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,200
How do you win at each type of work?

250
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,020
And what do you want to win by doing?

251
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,020
So that brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point.

252
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,400
Startups are all consuming.

253
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,519
If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree that you cannot imagine.

254
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,519
And if it succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time.

255
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,419
For several years at the very least, maybe a decade, maybe the rest of your working life.

256
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,899
So there's a real opportunity cost here.

257
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,019
It may seem to you that Larry Page has an enviable life, but

258
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,000
there are parts of it that are definitely unenviable.

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,399
The way the world looks to him is that he started running as fast as he could at age 25.

260
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,539
And he has not stopped to catch his breath since.

261
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:15,199
Every day, shit happens within the Google empire that only the emperor can deal with.

262
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,439
And he, as the emperor, has to deal with it.

263
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:23,399
If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole backlog of shit accumulates.

264
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,399
And he has to bear this uncomplainingly.

265
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,860
Because number one, as the company's daddy, he can never show fear or weakness.

266
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,220
And number two, if you're a billionaire, you get zero, actually less than zero sympathy,

267
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,000
if you complain about having a difficult life.

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,379
Which has this strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful

269
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,259
startup founder is concealed from almost everyone who's done it.

270
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:53,080
People who win the 100 meters in the Olympics, like they walk up to them and

271
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,860
they're going like .

272
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,919
Larry Page is doing that too, but you never get to see it.

273
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,720
All right, where are we?

274
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,580
Y Combinator has now funded several companies that could be called big successes.

275
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,419
And in every single case, the founders say the same thing.

276
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,240
It never gets any easier.

277
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,960
The nature of the problems change.

278
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,840
So you may be worrying about more glamorous problems like construction delays in

279
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,759
your new London offices rather than the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.

280
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,759
The total volume of worry never decreases.

281
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,840
If anything, it increases.

282
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,500
Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it's like a button

283
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,340
you press that changes your life irrevocably.

284
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,840
And while it is like honestly the best thing in the world, having kids,

285
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,220
if you take away one thing from this lecture, remember that.

286
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:55,460
There are a lot of things that are easier to do before you have kids than after.

287
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,060
Many of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids.

288
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,680
And so, in rich countries, most people delay pushing the button for a while.

289
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,980
And I'm sure you are all intimately familiar with that procedure.

290
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,960
Yet, when it comes to starting startups, a lot of people seem to think they're

291
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,720
supposed to start them in college.

292
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,100
Are you crazy?

293
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,019
And what are the universities thinking?

294
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,579
They go out of their way to ensure that their students are well supplied with

295
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,700
contraceptives, and yet they're starting up entrepreneurship programs and

296
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,460
startup incubators left and right.

297
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,059
To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.

298
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,000
A lot of incoming students are interested in startups.

299
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,700
Universities are at least de facto supposed to prepare you for your career.

300
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,840
And so, if you're interested in startups, it seems like universities are supposed

301
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,019
to teach you about startups.

302
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:50,700
And if they don't, maybe they lose applicants to universities who do claim to do that.

303
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,140
So, can universities teach you about startups?

304
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,920
Well, if not, what are we doing here?

305
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,580
Yes and no.

306
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,240
As I explained, they can teach you about startups, but

307
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,420
this is not what you need to know.

308
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,700
Essentially, if you want to learn French,

309
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,019
universities can teach you linguistics.

310
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,759
That's what this is, this is a linguistics class, right?

311
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,700
We're teaching you about how to learn languages.

312
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,519
And what you need to know is like, how to learn a particular language.

313
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:21,379
What you need to know are the needs of your own users.

314
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,000
You can't learn those until you actually start the company.

315
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,680
And starting a company, which means that starting a startup is something,

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,539
and you can intrinsically only learn by doing it.

317
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,319
And you can't do that in college for

318
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,299
the reason I just explained that startups take over your entire life.

319
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,379
If you start a startup in college, if you start a startup as a student,

320
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:41,759
you can't start a startup as a student.

321
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,700
Because if you start a startup, you're not a student anymore.

322
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,119
You may be nominally a student, but

323
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,119
you won't even be that for much longer.

324
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,200
So, given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?

325
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,799
Be a real student and not start a startup?

326
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,980
Or start a real startup and not be a student?

327
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,839
Well, I can answer that one for you.

328
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,539
I'm talking to my own kids here.

329
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,899
Do not start a startup in college.

330
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:06,960
I hope I'm not disappointing anyone.

331
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,980
Seriously, honestly.

332
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,899
Starting a startup could be a component of a good life for

333
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,440
a lot of ambitious people.

334
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,379
But this is just part of a much bigger problem that you're trying to solve.

335
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:20,440
How to have a good life, right?

336
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,339
And though starting a startup could be a good thing to do at some point,

337
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,679
20 is not the optimal time to do it.

338
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,539
There are things that you can't,

339
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:33,819
there are things you can do in your early 20s that you cannot do as well before or

340
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:38,759
after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim that seem like they'll have no

341
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,599
payoff, or travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.

342
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,819
In fact, those are really just isomorphic shapes in different domains.

343
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,980
For unambitious people, this sort of thing can be the dreaded failure to launch.

344
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,519
But for the ambitious ones, it's a really valuable sort of exploration.

345
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,180
And if you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,

346
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,160
you will never get to do it.

347
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,539
Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.

348
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,599
If he goes to a foreign country, it's either as a de facto state visit,

349
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,980
or like he's hiding out incognito at the George, the George Sank in Paris, right?

350
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,339
But he's never gonna get to just like backpack around Thailand,

351
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,700
if that's still what people do.

352
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,680
Do people still backpack around Thailand?

353
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,519
Yes.

354
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,539
Okay.

355
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,380
Well, that's the first real sign of enthusiasm I've seen from this audience.

356
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,019
Should have given this talk in Thailand.

357
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,700
All right.

358
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,079
He can do things that you can't do,

359
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,360
like chartered jets to fly him to foreign countries, really big jets.

360
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,420
But success has taken a lot of the serendipity out of his life.

361
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,220
He, Facebook is running him as much as he's running Facebook.

362
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,539
And while it can be really cool to be in the grip of some project,

363
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:58,960
you consider your life's work.

364
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,920
There are advantages to serendipity.

365
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,620
And among other things, it gives you more options to choose your life's work from.

366
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,320
There's not even a trade off here.

367
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,879
You're not sacrificing anything if you forego starting a startup at 20.

368
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:18,679
Cuz you'll be more likely to succeed if you wait.

369
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,819
In the unlikely case that you're 20, like astronomically unlikely case,

370
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:28,059
that you're 20 and you have some side project that takes off like Facebook did.

371
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,919
Then you face a choice of either running with it or not, and

372
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,099
maybe it's reasonable to run with it.

373
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,219
But usually the way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off.

374
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,859
And it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.

375
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,599
So, should you do it at any age?

376
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,839
I realize I've made starting a startup sound kind of hard.

377
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,599
If I haven't, let me try again.

378
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,480
Starting a startup is really hard.

379
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,219
What if it's too hard?

380
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,399
What if you're not up to this challenge?

381
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,200
The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point.

382
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,160
You can't tell.

383
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,880
Your life so far has given you some idea what your prospects might be if you

384
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,720
wanted to become a mathematician or a professional football player.

385
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,840
And boy, it's not every audience you could say that to.

386
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,900
But unless you have had a very strange life indeed,

387
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,920
you have not done much that's like starting a startup.

388
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,740
Meaning starting a startup will change you a lot if it works out.

389
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,460
So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but

390
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,059
what you could become and who can do that?

391
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,180
Well, not me.

392
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,279
For the last nine years, it was my job to try and

393
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,180
guess whether people would guess.

394
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,019
I wrote predict in here and it came out as guess.

395
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,180
That's a very informative Freudian slip.

396
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,160
Seriously, it's easy to tell how smart people are in 10 minutes.

397
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
You know, hit a few tennis balls over the net and

398
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,180
do they hit them back at you or into the net.

399
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
But the hard part was, and

400
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,619
the most important part was predicting how tough and

401
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:02,940
ambitious they would become.

402
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,400
There may be no one at this point who has more experience than me at doing this.

403
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,160
And I can tell you how much an expert can know about that.

404
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,220
The answer is not much.

405
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,019
I learned from experience to keep a completely open mind about which

406
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,220
startup in each batch, which startups would turn out to be the stars.

407
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,460
The founders sometimes thought they knew.

408
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,660
Some arrived feeling confident that they would ace Y Combinator,

409
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,140
just as they had aced every one of the few easy artificial tests they had

410
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,100
faced in life so far.

411
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,779
Others arrived wondering what mistake had caused them to be admitted and

412
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,720
hoping that no one would discover it.

413
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,339
But there is little to no atti- no correlation between these attitudes and

414
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:46,279
how things turn out.

415
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,899
I've read the same is true in the military,

416
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:54,700
that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really tough

417
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,279
than the quiet ones, and probably for the same reason.

418
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,279
That the tests are so different from the tests in people's previous lives.

419
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,180
If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup,

420
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,660
you probably shouldn't do it, unless you're one of those people who gets

421
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,119
off on doing things you're afraid of.

422
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,200
Otherwise, if you're merely unsure of whether you're gonna be able to do it,

423
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,960
the only way to find out is to try.

424
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,420
Just not now.

425
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,640
So, if you wanna start a startup one day,

426
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,120
if you wanna start a startup one day, what do you do now in college?

427
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,539
There are only two things you need initially, an idea and co-founders.

428
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,880
And the MO for getting them both is the same,

429
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,940
which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point.

430
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,320
The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.

431
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,860
I've written a whole essay on this and

432
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,420
I'm not gonna repeat the whole thing here.

433
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,539
But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to try and

434
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,900
think of startup ideas, you will, I think of ideas that are not only bad,

435
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,000
but bad and plausible sounding.

436
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,440
Meaning you and everybody else will be fooled by them and

437
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,900
you'll waste a lot of time before realizing they're no good.

438
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,400
The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.

439
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,060
Instead of trying to make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,

440
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,400
turn your brain into the type that has startup ideas unconsciously.

441
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,840
In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

442
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,920
This is not only possible.

443
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,840
Yahoo, Google, Facebook, and Apple all got started this way.

444
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,679
None of these companies were even supposed to be companies at first.

445
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,139
They were all just side projects.

446
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:43,399
The very best ideas almost have to start as side projects because they're always such

447
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,119
outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.

448
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,099
Okay?

449
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,779
So how do you turn your mind into the kind that has startup ideas unconsciously?

450
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,779
One, learn a lot about things that matter.

451
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:02,000
Two, work on problems that interest you.

452
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,180
Three, with people you like and respect.

453
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,599
That third part incidentally is how you get co-founders at the same time as the idea.

454
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,480
The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of learn a lot about things that matter,

455
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,539
I wrote become good at some technology.

456
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:24,059
But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.

457
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:30,659
What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia from Airbnb was not that they were experts in technology.

458
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:31,659
They went to art school.

459
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,240
They were experts in design.

460
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,240
And perhaps even more importantly, they were really good at organizing people and getting projects done.

461
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,460
So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on things that stretch you.

462
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,839
What kind of things are those?

463
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,920
Now that is very hard to answer in the general case.

464
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,420
History is full of examples of young people who are working on problems that no one else at the time thought were important.

465
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,079
And in particular, that their parents didn't think they were important.

466
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:13,460
On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right.

467
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,179
So how do you know if you're working on real stuff?

468
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:24,319
I mean, when Twitch TV switched from being Justin.TV to Twitch TV and

469
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,939
they were going to broadcast people playing video games, I was like, what?

470
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:30,319
But it turned out to be a good business.

471
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:36,579
Well, I know how I know real problems are interesting.

472
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:37,819
And I'm self-indulgent.

473
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:42,220
I like, I'm always interested in working on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them.

474
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,319
And I find it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be important.

475
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,759
My life is full of case after case where I worked on things just because I was interested and

476
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,700
they turned out to be useful later in some worldly way.

477
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,259
Y Combinator itself is something I only did because it seemed interesting.

478
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:02,799
So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out.

479
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,819
But this is for you, not me.

480
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:07,200
And I don't know what you have in your heads.

481
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,619
Maybe if I think more about it, I could come up with some heuristics for

482
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:12,920
recognizing genuinely interesting ideas.

483
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,460
But for now, all I can give you is the hopelessly question begging advice.

484
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,599
Incidentally, this is the actual meaning of the phrase, begging the question.

485
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,839
The hopelessly question begging advice that if you're interested in genuinely interesting

486
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,599
problems, gratifying your interest energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.

487
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,659
And for that matter, probably the best way to live.

488
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,799
But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem,

489
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,019
I can tell you about a large subset of them.

490
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:50,199
If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a sort of fractal stain,

491
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,759
every point on the edge that's moving represents an interesting problem.

492
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,080
Steam engines, not so much.

493
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,620
Although maybe, you never know.

494
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,380
So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in

495
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,140
unconsciously is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology to, as Paul

496
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,400
Buchheit put it, live in the future.

497
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,580
And when you get there, ideas that seem uncannily prescient to other people will seem obvious

498
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,540
to you.

499
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,780
You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought

500
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,280
to exist.

501
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,320
For example, back at Harvard, back in the mid-90s, a fellow grad student of my friends,

502
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
Robert and Trevor, wrote his own voice over IP software.

503
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,180
It wasn't meant to be a startup.

504
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,759
He never tried to turn it into one.

505
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,080
He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long distance calls.

506
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:49,000
And since he was an expert on networks, it seemed obvious to him that the thing to do was turn

507
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,579
the sound into packets and ship them over the internet for free.

508
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:53,720
Why didn't everybody do this?

509
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,679
Well, because they weren't good at writing that kind of software.

510
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,839
He never did anything with this.

511
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,319
He never tried to turn it into a startup.

512
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,939
But that is how all the best startups tend to happen.

513
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:10,220
So strangely enough, the optimal thing to do in college, if you want to be a successful

514
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:18,100
startup founder, is not some sort of new vocational version of college focused on entrepreneurship.

515
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,120
It's the classic version of college, is education for its own sake.

516
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,740
If you want to start a startup, what you should do in college is learn powerful things.

517
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,259
And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if

518
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,680
you just follow your own inclinations.

519
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,079
The component of entrepreneurship, I can never quite say that word with a straight face,

520
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,859
that really matters is domain expertise.

521
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:49,400
Larry Page is Larry Page because he was an expert on search.

522
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,319
And the way he became an expert on search was because he was genuinely interested in it,

523
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,160
not because of some ulterior motive.

524
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,879
At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity.

525
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,060
And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive at the end of the process.

526
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:13,060
So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders reduced to two words.

527
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,000
Just learn.

528
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,120
All right, how much time do we have left?

529
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,720
18 minutes.

530
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,040
18 minutes of questions, good God.

531
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Do you guys have the questions?

532
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,560
Sure, we'll start with two questions online or we can start with audience.

533
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,880
You guys are in charge, whatever you want to do.

534
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,940
Okay, so to start with online questions, the most voted question today was-

535
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,060
Do I have to repeat them by the way?

536
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,560
Yeah.

537
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,060
Okay.

538
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,820
How can a non-technical founder most effectively contribute to a startup?

539
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,640
How can a non-technical founder most effectively contribute to a startup?

540
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,700
Well, if the startup is, if the startup is working in some domain,

541
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,759
if it's not a pure technology startup, but is working in some very specific domain,

542
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,759
like if it's Uber, right?

543
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,880
And the non-technical founder was an expert in the limo business, then actually,

544
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,880
the non-technical founder would probably be doing most of the work,

545
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,340
recruiting drivers and doing whatever else Uber has to do, right?

546
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,959
And the technical founder would be just writing the iPhone app,

547
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:21,099
which is probably less, well, iPhone and Android app,

548
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:24,099
which is less than half of it.

549
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:30,899
If it's a purely technology startup, the non-technical founder does sales,

550
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,279
and brings coffee and cheeseburgers to the programmer.

551
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,279
Okay.

552
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,279
Okay.

553
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,279
Next.

554
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,279
Oh, audience.

555
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,279
Okay.

556
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,279
Audience.

557
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,279
Yes.

558
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,279
Do you see any value in business school for

559
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,279
people who want to pursue entrepreneurship?

560
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,279
Do I see any value in-

561
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,279
Or if so, what value?

562
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,279
I guess.

563
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,279
I'm hoping it's-

564
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,279
Well, we probably won't have to get to the second question.

565
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,279
Which I suppose is the answer to your first question.

566
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,279
Okay.

567
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,279
So the question is, is there any value in business school,

568
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,279
if you're interested in entrepreneurship?

569
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
And if so, what?

570
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,279
So basically, no.

571
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,279
I mean, it sounds undiplomatic, but the point-

572
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:18,279
What business school was designed for is to teach people management, right?

573
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,279
And management is a problem that you only have in a startup if you're sufficiently successful.

574
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:31,279
So really, what you need to know early on to make a startup successful is developing products.

575
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,279
You'd be better off going to design school if you want to go to some sort of school.

576
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,279
Although frankly, the way to learn how to do it is just to do it.

577
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,279
You know?

578
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,279
One of the things I got wrong early on is that I advised people who were interested in starting

579
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:49,279
a startup to go work for some other company for a few years before starting their own.

580
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,279
But honestly, the best way to learn how to start a startup is just to try and start it.

581
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,279
You may not be successful, but you'll learn faster if you just do it.

582
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,279
So, not really.

583
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,279
Business schools are trying really hard to do this.

584
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:10,279
But honestly, like they were designed to train the officer core of large companies, right?

585
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:16,279
Which is what business seemed to be back when it was a choice of either the officer core of large companies or Joe's shoe store.

586
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:24,280
And then there was this new thing, Apple, which started out as small as Joe's shoe store and then like turns into this giant mega company.

587
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
But they weren't designed for that world.

588
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
And like let, they're good at what they're good at.

589
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,280
They should just be do that and screw this whole entrepreneurship thing just because it's cool.

590
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Yes.

591
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
You said management is a problem that you have only when you're successful.

592
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Yeah.

593
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,280
So what about those first two or three people as a founder that you try to manage?

594
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Okay.

595
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
So management is a problem only if you're successful.

596
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
What about those first two or three people?

597
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Well, ideally, you're successful before you even hire two or three people, right?

598
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,280
Didn't you say, Sam, that Airbnb took five months to hire their first employee?

599
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,280
So ideally, you don't have even two or three people for quite a while.

600
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:15,280
When you do, you can sort of, the first hires in a startup are almost like founders.

601
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,280
They should be motivated by the same things.

602
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
They can't be people.

603
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,280
They can't be people you have to like manage, right?

604
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
This is like that.

605
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,280
This is not like the office or something like that.

606
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,280
These are your, these have to be your peers really.

607
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
You shouldn't have to manage them much.

608
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,280
So is it just a big no-no like someone has to manage no way they can be on the founding team?

609
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Well, never say never.

610
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
The qu-, I should repeat all these questions.

611
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,280
So if someone has to manage no way they should be on the founding team,

612
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,280
in the case where you're doing something where you need some sort of super advanced technical thing,

613
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,280
and there's some boffin, if you know that word, who knows this thing and nothing else in the world,

614
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:05,280
including like how to wipe his mouth, then it may be to your advantage to hire said boffin and wipe his mouth for him.

615
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:15,280
But as a general rule, you want people who are sort of self-motivated early on.

616
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
They should be just like founders.

617
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Yes, questions in the far back.

618
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Do you think we're currently in a bubble?

619
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Do I think we're currently in a bubble?

620
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Okay, so I'll give you two answers to this question.

621
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,280
One, ask me questions that are useful to this audience,

622
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
because these people are here to learn how to start startups.

623
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,280
And I have in my head like more data about that than anybody else.

624
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
And you're asking me the kind of questions a reporter does,

625
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
because they can't think of anything interesting to ask.

626
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,280
But I will answer your question.

627
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,280
There is a difference between prices merely being high and a bubble.

628
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,280
A bubble is a very specific form of prices being high,

629
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,280
where people knowingly pay high prices for something in the hope that they will be able to unload it later on some greater fool.

630
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Right?

631
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
And that's what happened in the late 90s.

632
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Like, VCs knowingly invested in bullshit startups thinking that they would be able to take those things public

633
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
and unload them on the retail investors before everything blew up.

634
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
And I was there.

635
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,280
I was there for that, at the epicenter of it all.

636
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
And that is not what's happening today.

637
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Prices are high.

638
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Valuations are high.

639
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
But valuations being high does not mean a bubble.

640
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Every commodity has prices that go up and down in some sort of sine wave.

641
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Definitely prices are high.

642
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,280
And so we tell people, if you raise money, don't think the next time you raise money it's going to be so easy.

643
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Who knows?

644
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Maybe between now and then, the Chinese economy will have exploded and there's another giant disastrous recession.

645
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Who knows?

646
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
Assume the worst.

647
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
But bubble, no.

648
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Yes?

649
00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I'm noticing a trend among young people and successful entrepreneurs where they don't want to start one more great company.

650
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
They want to start like 20.

651
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,280
And so you're starting to see the rise of these labs attempts where they're going to try to launch a bunch of stuff.

652
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I don't know a really stellar example yet, but do you see-

653
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
You mean like, like, Ideal?

654
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Like, no, like, like, like, Idealab, like, uh, Garrett Camp's new one.

655
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
This is North, yeah.

656
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

657
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Okay.

658
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
So there's this new thing where people start labs that are supposed to spin off startups.

659
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
It might work.

660
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
That's how Twitter started.

661
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,280
In fact, I meant Idealab, not IDEO.

662
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
That was another Freudian slip.

663
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Because Twitter was not Twitter at first.

664
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Twitter was the side project.

665
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Side project at a company called IDEO that was supposed to be in the podcasting business.

666
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
You're like, podcasting business.

667
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Do those words even grammatically fit together?

668
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,280
The answer turned out to be no, as Evan discovered.

669
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,280
But like, as a side project, they spun off Twitter and boy was that a dog wagging tail.

670
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,280
So people are starting these things that are supposed to spin off startups.

671
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Will it work?

672
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Quite possibly.

673
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Quite possibly if the right people do it.

674
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,280
You can't do it yet though because you have to do it with your own money.

675
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Yes, far back.

676
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Thanks so much.

677
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,280
I need to step into sort of a gendered pitfall.

678
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,280
But what advice do you have for female co-founders as you're pursuing funding?

679
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Female co-founders when you're pursuing funding.

680
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Well, it probably is true that women have a harder time raising money, right?

681
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I've noticed this empirically and Jessica is just about to publish a bunch of interviews

682
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,280
with female founders and a lot of them said that they thought they had a harder time raising money too.

683
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,280
So, what I would, you remember I said like the way to raise money, make your startup actually do well.

684
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Well, that's just especially true in that case.

685
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,280
If you have any, if you miss the ideal target from the VC's point of view in any respect,

686
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,280
the way to solve that problem is make the startup do really well.

687
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,280
So, in fact, there was a point like a year or two ago when I tweeted this growth graph of this company.

688
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,280
And I didn't say who they were, but I knew it would start people asking.

689
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,280
And it was actually a female founded startup that was having trouble raising money,

690
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
but their growth graph was stupendous.

691
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,280
And so I tweeted it knowing that like all these VCs would start asking me, who is that, right?

692
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
And like growth graphs have no gender, right?

693
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,280
So if they see the growth graph first, let them fall in love with that, right?

694
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,280
So do well, which is good advice for startups generally.

695
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Yes?

696
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
What would you learn in college right now?

697
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
What what?

698
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
What would you learn in college right now?

699
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
What would I learn in college?

700
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Hmm.

701
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Hmm.

702
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Literary theory?

703
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
No, just kidding.

704
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Let's see.

705
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Well, you know, honestly, I think I might try and study physics.

706
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
I feel that's the thing I feel like I missed.

707
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,280
For some reason, like I was all excited.

708
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
When I was a kid, computers were the thing.

709
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Maybe they still are, right?

710
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,280
So I sort of got very excited about writing code.

711
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
And you could do things with, you could do,

712
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
you could write real programs in your bedroom.

713
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
You can't like build real linear accelerators.

714
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Maybe you can.

715
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,280
So maybe, maybe physics.

716
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
I feel kind of, I always, I sort of look,

717
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I notice I sort of look longingly at physics.

718
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,280
So maybe, but I don't know if that's, what am I saying?

719
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm saying, I was about to say,

720
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
I don't know if that's going to be helpful starting a startup.

721
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,280
And I've just told you to follow your own curiosity.

722
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
So who cares if it's helpful?

723
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
It will turn out to be helpful.

724
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Questions?

725
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Another question online.

726
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,280
What are your recurring systems in your work and personal life

727
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
that make you efficient?

728
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Ah, boy.

729
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Okay.

730
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,280
So what are my recurring systems in my work and personal life

731
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,280
that make me efficient?

732
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
Well, having kids is a good way to be efficient.

733
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Because you have no time left.

734
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
So if you want to get anything done,

735
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,280
the amount of done you do per time is high.

736
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,280
So actually many parents,

737
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,280
many startup founders who have kids have made that point explicitly.

738
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,280
It causes you to focus because you have no choice.

739
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Let's see, but that's not, I wouldn't actually recommend having kids just to make you more focused.

740
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,280
So, let's see.

741
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,280
You know, I don't think I'm very efficient.

742
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I have two ways of getting work done.

743
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,280
One is like during Y Combinator, the way I worked on Y Combinator is I was forced to, right?

744
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Like there were, there was an app, I had to set the application deadline.

745
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
And then people would apply.

746
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,280
And then there were all these applications that I had to respond to by a certain time.

747
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,280
So I had to read them and I knew if I read them badly, we would get bad startups.

748
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
So I tried really hard to read them well, right?

749
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,280
And so I set up this situation that forced me to work.

750
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,280
The other kind of work I do is like writing essays.

751
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
And I do that involuntarily.

752
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,280
I'm like walking down the street and the essay starts writing itself in my head.

753
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,280
And so really, I either force myself to work on less exciting things.

754
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Or the, I can't help working on, on exciting things.

755
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,280
And I don't, I don't have any useful techniques for making myself efficient.

756
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,280
Sorry.

757
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,280
If you work on things you like, you don't have to force yourself to be efficient.

758
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Yes?

759
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,280
When is a good time to turn a side project into a real startup?

760
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,280
When is a good time to turn a side project into a startup?

761
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
You will know, right?

762
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,280
What will be the start to be like, you can have the operating and the ready.

763
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
It starts, you, you, when you, okay.

764
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,280
So the question is when do you turn a startup into a side project into a real startup?

765
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,280
You will know that it's becoming a real startup when it takes over an alarming percentage of your life.

766
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
Right?

767
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Like when you find like, my God, I've just spent all day working on this thing that's supposed to be a side project.

768
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
I'm going to fail all my classes.

769
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
What am I going to do?

770
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Right?

771
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
Then maybe it's turning into a startup.

772
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
Yes?

773
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Wait, I already answered your question.

774
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
I should ask, I should let somebody else ask.

775
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
I may get back to you.

776
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Yes?

777
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,280
I know you talked a lot earlier about you'll know when your startup is doing extremely well.

778
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,280
But I feel like in a lot of cases, it's just a bit of a gray line where it's like, you know, you have some users but maybe not.

779
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
It's explosive growth.

780
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
Chart isn't up to the right.

781
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,280
How, what would you do or what would you recommend doing in those situations?

782
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,280
Considering you're allocating time and resources.

783
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
How do you balance in?

784
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Okay, when a startup is sort of growing but not much.

785
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,280
Mm-hm.

786
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,280
Didn't you tell them they were supposed to read do things that don't scale?

787
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Yeah.

788
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,280
You, sir, have not done the readings and you are busted therefore.

789
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,280
Because I wrote a whole essay in answer to that question and that is it.

790
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
Do things that don't scale.

791
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
So just go read that.

792
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Because I can't remember everything I said.

793
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
But it's about exactly that problem.

794
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Yes, back there.

795
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,280
What kind of startup should not go through incubation in your opinion?

796
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,280
What kind of, you mean, do you mean incubation L-O-Y-C?

797
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
No, yeah, Y-C or.

798
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,280
What kind of startup should not go through Y-C?

799
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Definitely any that will fail.

800
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,280
And or if you'll succeed but you're an intolerable person.

801
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,280
That also Sam would probably sooner do without.

802
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:16,280
Short of that, I cannot think of any because a large percentage,

803
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,280
founders are often surprised by how large a percentage of the problems

804
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,280
that startups have are the same regardless of what type of thing they're working on.

805
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,280
And those tend to be the kind of problems that Y-C helps with the most,

806
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,280
not the ones that are domain specific.

807
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,280
So I can't, is there, can you think of a class of startups that Y-C wouldn't work for?

808
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
I can't.

809
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,280
I mean we had like fission and fusion startups in the last batch.

810
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,280
Or the they had.

811
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
Yes?

812
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,280
You mentioned that it's good advice to learn a lot about something that matters.

813
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Yeah.

814
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,280
What are some good strategies to figure out what matters?

815
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Well, if you think of, okay, so how do you figure out what matters?

816
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:00,280
If you think of technology as something that's spreading as a sort of fractal stain,

817
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,280
anything on the edge represents an interesting idea.

818
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Sounds familiar.

819
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,280
So how do you figure out, like I said, that was the problem.

820
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,280
You have correctly identified the thing where I didn't really answer the question,

821
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
where I gave this question begging answer.

822
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,280
I said like that I just like I'm interested in interesting things.

823
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,280
If you're interested in interesting things, work on them and things will all work out, right?

824
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,280
But how do you tell what is a real problem?

825
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I don't know.

826
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,280
That's like important enough to write a whole essay about and I don't know the answer.

827
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
I probably should write something about that.

828
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
But I don't know.

829
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
I don't know.

830
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,280
I figured out a technique for detecting whether you have a taste for genuinely interesting

831
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,280
problems, which is whether you find working on boring things intolerable, right?

832
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,280
And there are known boring things like literary theory and working in middle management in some

833
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
large company.

834
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,280
So if you could tolerate those things, then you must not, you must either have stupendous

835
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,280
self-discipline or you don't have a taste for genuinely interesting problems.

836
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
And vice versa.

837
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Yes?

838
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
One more question.

839
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
Okay, one more question.

840
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
It better be good.

841
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,280
I was just wondering how, like, Snapchat, like, makes money on the use of the pages.

842
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Snapchat?

843
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,280
What do I know about Snapchat?

844
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,280
We didn't fund them.

845
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,280
How about another question?

846
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,280
All right, go ahead.

847
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,280
So you're talking about hiring people that you like, but it seems like that could lead to

848
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
monoculture.

849
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,280
And there are a lot of benefits met with monoculture, but how do you deal with the blind spots that

850
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
arise?

851
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,280
Okay, so if you hire people you like, you might get a monoculture.

852
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,280
And how do you deal with the blind spots that arise?

853
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,280
Starting a startup is something where many things will be going wrong.

854
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
You can't expect it to be perfect.

855
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,280
And the advantages of hiring people that you know and like are far greater than the, you know,

856
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,280
the small disadvantage of, disadvantages of having some monoculture.

857
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,280
You look at it empirically, all the most successful startups, someone just like hires all their

858
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
pals out of college.

859
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
All right, you guys.

860
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,280
Thank you.
