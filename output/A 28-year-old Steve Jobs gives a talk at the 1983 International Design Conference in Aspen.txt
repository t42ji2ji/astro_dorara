Good morning.
Introductions are really funny.
They paid me $60, so I wore a tie.
How many people, how many of you are 36 years, older than 36 years old?
Yeah, you were born pre-computer.
The computer is 36 years old.
And there's something sort of, I think that there's going to be a little slice in the timeline of history as we look back.
Pretty meaningful slice right there.
A lot of you are products of the television generation.
I'm pretty much a product of the television generation.
But to some extent, starting to be a product of the computer generation.
And the kids growing up now are definitely products of the computer generation.
And in their lifetimes, the computer will become the predominant medium of communication,
just as the television took over from the radio, took over from even the book.
Boy, I'll talk about anything you want to talk about today.
I have about 15 or 20 minutes of stuff that I just wanted to cover really quickly.
And then whatever you want to talk about, we can talk about.
How's that?
Yeah?
How many of you own an Apple?
Any?
Or just any personal computer?
Uh-oh.
How many of you have used one or seen one?
Anything like that?
Good.
Okay.
Let's start off with what is a computer?
What is a computer?
It's really simple.
It's just a simple machine.
But it's a new type of machine.
The gears, the pistons, have been replaced with electrons.
How many of you have ever seen an electron?
That's the problem with computers,
is that you can't get your hands on the actual things that are moving around.
You can't see them.
And so they tend to be very intimidating,
because in a very small space there's billions of electrons running around,
and we can't really get a hold on exactly what they look like.
Computers are very adaptive.
It's a very adaptive machine.
We can move the electrons around differently, to different places,
depending upon the current state of affairs,
the results of the last time we moved the electrons around.
So if you were here last night and you heard about the brain and how it's very adaptive,
a computer is in the same way very, very adaptive.
Second thing about a computer, it's very new.
It was invented 36 years ago in 1947.
The world's first degree in computer science offered by a university,
which was the University of California at Berkeley,
and it was a master's degree,
was offered in 1968,
which means the oldest person that has a degree in computer science is 39 years old.
And the average age of professionals at Apple is under 30.
So it's a field that's dominated by fairly young people.
Third thing about computers,
they're really dumb.
They're exceptionally simple, but they're really fast.
The raw instructions that we have to feed these little microprocessors,
even the raw instructions that we have to feed these giant Cray-1 supercomputers,
are the most trivial of instructions.
They're get some data from here, get a number from here, fetch a number,
add two numbers together, test to see if it's bigger than zero,
go put it over there.
It's the most mundane thing you could ever imagine.
But the key thing about it is that,
let's say I could move a hundred times faster than anyone in here.
In the blink of your eye,
I could run out there,
and I could grab a bouquet of fresh spring flowers or something,
and I could run back in here,
and I could snap my fingers,
and you'd all think I was a magician or something.
And yet, I was basically doing a series of really simple instructions,
moving, running out there, grabbing some flowers,
running back, snapping my fingers,
but I could just do them so fast
that you would think that there was something magical going on.
It's the exact same way with the computer.
It can go grab these numbers and add them together
and throw them over here
at the rate of about a million instructions per second.
And so we tend to think there's something magical going on
when in reality there's just a series of these simple instructions.
Now, what we do is we take these very, very simple instructions,
and we, by building a collection of these things,
build a higher level instruction.
So instead of saying,
turn right, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot,
extend hand, grab flowers, run back,
I can say, could you go get some flowers?
Could you pour a cup of coffee?
And we have started in the last 20 years
to deal with computers in higher and higher levels of abstraction.
But ultimately, these levels of abstraction
get translated down into these stupid instructions
that run really fast.
Let's look at the brief history of computers.
Best way to understand it's probably an analogy.
Take the electric motor.
The electric motor was first invented in the late 1800s.
And when it was first invented,
it was only possible to build a very, very large one,
which meant that it could only be cost justified
for very large applications.
And therefore, electric motors did not proliferate very fast at all.
But the next breakthrough
was when somebody took one of these large electric motors
and they ran a shaft through the middle of a factory
and through a series of belts and pulleys,
brought, shared the horsepower of this one large electric motor
on 15 or 20 medium-sized workstations,
thereby allowing one electric motor
to be cost justified on some medium-scale tasks.
And electric motors proliferated even further then.
But the real breakthrough was the invention
of the fractional horsepower electric motor.
However, we could then bring the horsepower
directly to where it was needed
and cost justified on a totally individual application.
And I think there's about 55 or so fractional horsepower motors
now in every household.
If we look at the development of computers,
we see a real parallel.
The first computer was called the ENIAC in 1947.
It was developed particularly for ballistic military calculations.
It was giant.
Hardly anyone got a chance to use it.
The real breakthrough, the next real breakthrough,
was in the 60s with the invention of what was called time sharing.
And what we did was we took one of these very large computers
and we shared it.
Since it could execute so many instructions so quickly,
we'd run some on Fred's job over here
and then we'd run some on Sally's job
and we'd run some on Don's job
and we'd run some on Susie's job
and we'd share this thing.
And it was so fast that everyone would think
they had the whole computer to themselves.
Time sharing was what really started to proliferate computers in the 60s.
And most of you, if you've used computer terminals
connected with some umbilical cord
to some large computer somewhere else,
that's time sharing.
That's what got computers on college campuses in large numbers.
The reason Apple exists
is because we stumbled on to fractional horsepower computing
five years before anybody else.
That's the reason we exist.
We took these microprocessor chips,
which is sort of a computer on a chip,
and we surrounded it with all the other stuff you need
to interact with a computer.
And we made a computer that was about 13 pounds.
And people would look at it and they'd say,
well, where's the computer?
This is just the terminal.
And we'd say, no, that is the computer.
And after about five minutes of repeating this,
they'd finally, a light bulb would go on in their minds.
And they'd decide if they didn't like it,
they could throw it out the window
or run over it with their car.
But that this was the entire computer.
That's why we exist.
Fractional horsepower computing.
This fractional horsepower computing
has created a revolution.
It was invented in 1976,
the first personal computer.
This year, in 1983,
the industry is going to ship
over three million of the little buggers.
Three million.
By 1986, we're going to ship more computers
than automobiles in this country.
And let me digress for a minute.
One of the reasons I'm here
is because I need your help.
If you've looked at computers,
they look like garbage.
All the great product designers
are off designing automobiles
or they're off designing buildings.
But hardly any of them
are designing computers.
And if we take a look,
we're going to sell those
three million computers this year.
We're going to sell those
ten million computers in 1986,
whether they look like a piece of shit
or they look great.
It doesn't really matter
because people are going to just
suck this stuff up so fast
that they're going to do it
no matter what it looks like.
And it doesn't cost any more money
to make it look great.
There are going to be these objects,
this new object that's going to be
in everyone's working environment
and is going to be
in everyone's educational environment
and is going to be
in everyone's home environment.
And we have a shot
at putting a great object there
or if we don't,
we're going to put
one more piece of junk object there.
By an 86, 87 pick a year,
people are going to be spending
more time interacting
with these machines
than they do interacting
with their big automobile machines today.
People are going to be spending
two, three hours a day sometimes
interacting with these machines
longer than they spend in a car.
And so the industrial design,
the software design
and how people interact
with these things
certainly must be given
the consideration
that we give automobiles today,
if not a lot more.
And if you take a look,
what we've got
is we've got a situation
where most of the automobiles
are not being designed
in the United States,
Europe, Japan.
Televisions,
audio electronics,
watches, cameras,
bicycles, calculators,
you name it,
most of the objects of our life
are not designed in America.
We've blown it.
We've blown it
from an industrial point of view
because we've lost
the markets
to the foreign competitors.
We've also blown it
in a design point of view.
And I think we have a chance
focusing on this new
computing technology
meeting people in the 80s.
The fact that computers
and society
are out on a first date
in the 80s.
we have a chance
to make these things beautiful
and we have a chance
to communicate something
through the design
of the objects themselves.
In addition to that,
we're going to spend
over $100 million
in the next 12 months
on media advertising.
Apple alone.
IBM will spend
at least an equivalent amount.
And we generate
tens of millions of dollars
worth of brochures,
posters,
more than the auto industry,
again, as a comparison.
And this stuff
can either be great
or it can be lousy.
And we need help.
We really, really need your help.
Okay, let's go back
to this revolution.
What is happening?
What's happening is
the personal computer
is a new medium
of communication.
One of the media.
So what's a media?
It's a technology communication.
A book is a medium.
Telephone, radio, television.
These are mediums
of communication.
And each medium
has pitfalls to it,
has shortcomings,
has boundaries
which you can't cross,
but it also generally
has some new unique opportunities.
The neat thing
is that each medium
shapes not only
the communication
that goes through it,
but it shapes
the process of communication.
Perfect example.
If you compare
the telephone
to what we're seeing now
in electronic mail,
where we link
a bunch of computers together
and we can send messages
to an electronic mailbox,
which people can then receive
at their leisure,
we see that indeed,
in one sense,
we're sending voice
through these wires
and in another sense,
we're sending ones and zeros
through these wires.
So the content
that's traveling through the medium
is certainly different.
But the most interesting thing
that's different
is the process of communication.
When I talk on a telephone
with anyone,
we both have to be on the phone
at the same time.
When I'm working
or when I want to send something
to somebody
with a computer terminal,
I want to do a drawing
and zip it over
and put it in their mailbox,
they don't need to be there.
They can retrieve it
at 12 a.m. in the morning.
They can retrieve it
three days later.
They can be in New York
and retrieve it.
One of these days
when we have portable computers
with radio links,
they can be walking around Aspen
and retrieve it.
And so the process
of communication itself
changes as the mediums evolve.
So what I'm claiming
is that computers are a medium
and that personal computers
are a new and different medium
from large computers.
What happens
when a new medium
enters the scene
is that we tend to fall back
into old media habits.
And let's look at
a few transitions
from one medium to another.
Radio to television,
television to this incredible
new interactive medium
of the video disc.
If you go back
and you look at
the first television show,
they're basically radio shows
with a television camera
pointed at them.
And it took us
the better part of the 50s
to really understand
how television
was going to come
into its own
as its own medium.
And I really think
the first time
that a lot of people
were shook
into realizing
that television
had come of age
was the JFK funeral.
The nation,
a lot of the world,
experienced the JFK funeral
in their living room
at a level of intensity
that wouldn't have been
possible with radio.
I think another
more upbeat example
was the Apollo landing.
That experience
was not possible
with the previous medium.
And yet it took us
the better part of 20 years
for that one
to really evolve.
Let's look at
the next transition.
We have this optical video disc
which can store
55,000 images on a side
or an hour of video
randomly accessible.
What are we using it for?
Movies.
We're dropping back
into the old media habits.
There's a few experiments
though that are starting
to happen
and you start to believe
that five years,
ten years from now
that's going to come
into its own.
A neat experiment
happened right here in Aspen.
MIT came out to Aspen
about four or five years,
I think about four years ago.
And they had this truck
with this camera on it
and they went down
every single street,
photographed every single
intersection
in every single street
in Aspen.
They photographed
all the buildings.
And they've got this computer
and this video disc
hooked up together
and on the screen
you see yourself
looking down a street
and you can touch the screen
and there's some arrows
on the screen
and you can touch
walk forward.
And all of a sudden
it's just like you're
walking forward in the street.
And you get to an intersection
and you can stop
and you can look right
and you can look straight
and you can look left
and you can decide
which way you want to go.
You can even go in
some of the shops.
It's an electronic map
that gives you the feeling
you're walking through Aspen.
Then there's four little buttons
in the corner
because they came back
and they did exactly
the same thing
all four seasons.
So you can be looking
down a street
hit winter
all of a sudden
you get the same street
with three feet of snow on it.
It's really amazing.
That's not incredibly useful
but it points
it points to some
of the interactive nature
of this new medium
which is just starting
to break out from movies
and is going to take
another five to ten years
to evolve.
Okay, let's go back
to computers.
We're in the
I Love Lucy stage
right now
in our medium development.
What we did
was microcomputers
personal computers
first come on the scene.
What do we do?
We fall back
into old media habits.
We run these weird languages
like COBOL.
We do business accounting
on them.
That's the kind of stuff
we have been doing
on them historically.
It took us about four years
before we started
breaking out of that
and we're just starting
to break out of it now.
When you look at Lisa
Lisa enables a person
like me
I'm not an artist
in the sense
that many of you are
I can sit down
and I can draw
artistic pictures
with that thing
because there's a program
called Lisa Draw
and if I don't like
what I've just drawn
I can erase it
I can move it
I can shrink it
I can grow it
I can change its texture
there's a little airbrush
the more I scrub
the darker it gets
I can put soft edges
on things
hard edges on things
and so I
I have no talent
at drawing at all
can make neat drawings
and then I can cut them out
and I can paste them
into my documents
so that I can combine
pictures and words
and then I can send it
onto the electronic mailbox
so somebody else
that's living here in Aspen
can dial up a phone number
and get their mail
and see this drawing
that I made.
So we're starting
to break out
and you can just see it now
and it's really exciting.
So where we are
is that the personal computer
is a new medium
and that society
and computers
are really meeting
for the first time
in the 80s.
In 15 years
it's going to be all over
in terms of this first phase
getting these tools
out into society
in large numbers
but during the next 15 years
if we really
we have an opportunity
to do it great
or to do it so-so
and what a lot of us
at Apple are working on
is trying to do it great.
I want to look at
one last thing
then we can talk about
whatever you want to talk about.
What is a computer program?
Do you know
what a computer program is?
Anybody?
No?
Sort of?
Sort of.
It's an odd thing.
It's really an odd thing.
You can't
I mean you've never
seen an electron
but computer programs
have no physical
manifestation at all.
They're simply ideas
expressed on paper.
Computer programs
are archetypal.
What do I mean by that?
Let's compare computer programming
to television programming.
Again
if you go back
and you look at the tapes
of the JFK funeral
in 1963 I guess
you'll start to cry.
You will feel
a lot of the same feelings
you felt
when you were watching that
20 years ago.
Why?
Because through
the art of television programming
we are very good
at capturing
a set
of experiences
an experience
two experiences
twenty experiences
and being able
to recreate them.
We're very good at that.
It takes a lot of money
and it's somewhat limited
but we can do
a pretty good job of that.
You can really feel
the excitement
of Neil Armstrong
landing on the moon.
Computer programming
does something
a little different.
What computer programming
does is it captures
the underlying principles
of an experience.
Not the experience itself
but the underlying principles
of the experience
and those principles
can enable
thousands of
different experiences
that all follow
those laws
if you will.
And the perfect example
is the video game.
What does the video game do?
It follows the laws
of gravity
of angular momentum
and it sets up
this stupid little
pawn game
but the ball
always follows
these laws.
No two pawn games
are ever the same
and yet every single
pawn game
follows these
underlying principles.
Give you another example.
There's a neat program
called Hammurabi.
And Hammurabi
there's seven year old
kids playing this
and it's a game
and it comes up
on the screen
and it goes
and you're King Hammurabi
and it goes
oh King Hammurabi
and you get to be
King Hammurabi
of the ancient kingdom
of Sumeria
for ten years.
It comes oh King Hammurabi
this is year one.
You have a thousand
bushels of wheat
in storage
you have a hundred people
and you have a hundred
acres of land.
Land is trading
at 24 bushels an acre.
Would you like to sell
any land?
No.
Would you like to buy
any land?
No.
How much would you like
to plant?
Or feed
how much would you like
to plant?
And it turns out
that if you don't plant
enough some of your
people will starve
the next year
and if you plant a lot
then people will come
from the surrounding
villages because you've
got a hot village
to live in
and you feed them well.
So you plant
a certain amount
but you need
then it says
how much
oh I'm sorry
so you feed your people
a certain amount
then it asks you
how much would you
like to plant?
And you have to plant
so much as well
in order to get the
grain the next year
but you can't plant
more acres
then you have people
to plant the acres
and so if you go
on a land buying spree
at the beginning
and you don't feed
your people well
because you spent
all your grain
buying land
then you don't have
the people to plant
the land
so it doesn't do
you any good.
If you don't plant
the land
and you feed
your people a ton
all these other people
come from the
surrounding villages
but they starve
the next year
and there are
these seven year old
and it goes on
year two
year three
and every once in a while
it throws in
the rats ate
some of the grain
and you're in deep
trouble
what are you going to do?
Kill some people
or sell some land
or whatever
and it's crude
but basically
there are these
seven year old kids
playing with this
macroeconomic model
and you can argue
about the content
of the model
but one thing
you can't argue about
they will sit there
for hours
and play that
and learn
and we've got to get
our models
better and better
and more sophisticated
but that is an
interactive way of learning
that none of us
ever had
when we were growing up
and again
thousands of individual
experiences
but all based
on that one set
of underlying principles
when I was
going to school
I had a few great teachers
and a lot of mediocre
teachers
and the thing
that probably kept me
out of jail
was books
because I could go read
what Aristotle wrote
or what Plato wrote
and I didn't have to have
an intermediary
in the way
and a book
was a phenomenal thing
it got right
from the source
to the destination
without anything
in the middle
the problem was
you can't ask
Aristotle a question
and I think
as we look
towards the next
50 to 100 years
if we really can
come up with
these machines
that can capture
an underlying spirit
or an underlying
set of principles
or an underlying
way of looking
at the world
then when the next
Aristotle comes around
maybe if he carries
around one of these
machines with him
his whole life
his or her whole life
and types in all
this stuff
then maybe someday
after the person's
dead and gone
we can ask this machine
hey what would
Aristotle have said
what about this
and maybe we won't
get the right answer
but maybe we will
and that's really
exciting to me
and that's one of the
reasons I'm doing
what I'm doing
so what do you
want to talk about
yeah
yeah
yeah it's a mess
okay
okay
how are these
computers all
going to work
together
they're going to
probably work
together a lot
like people
sometimes they're
going to work
together really
well and other
times they're not
going to work
together so well
what we've got
now is we are
putting a lot of
computers out that
are made to be used
pretty much in a
what we call a
standalone mode
one person one
computer but it
isn't very long
before you get a
community of users
using these things
that really want to
hook them all
together because
ultimately a
computer is going to
be a tool for
communication so
they want to hook
them together and
communicate and
over the next five
years the standards
for doing this are
going to evolve
they all speak
different languages
right now and
there's a I
heard a funny
story we we've
talked a lot with
AT&T American
Bell etc and
there's a funny
story about the
this is a true
story when the
old I talked to
this old guy who
was about 80
years old and he
was one of the
original telephone
installers and he
would go out and
he'd install
telephones and
people in farm
houses and they
had never seen
anything like this
and it takes two
wires he'd run
the two wires
down and he'd
hook up the
phone and he
was out installing
this phone for
this Italian family
in this farm and
he'd finished
installing the phone
and the guy asked
him well can I
speak Italian on
this phone and he
said why didn't you
tell me I got to run
a third wire it'll be
$50 extra so that's
where we are today and
what happened there's
been a few
installations where
people have hooked
these things together the
one installation that
stands out is a Xerox
did it a place called
Palo Alto Research
Center or PARC for
short and they hooked
about a hundred
computers together on
what's called a local
area network which is
just a cable that
carries all this
information back and
forth and an
interesting thing
happened when they did
that what happened was
was that you'd have a
distribution list so
you'd want to send a
memo to all the people
in this group and so
you'd say okay you'd
write a memo and you'd
send it to the
distribution list for all
the people interested in
the November forecast or
new product delta or
whatever you're working
on but then an
interesting thing
happened there were 20
people and they were
interested in volleyball so
a volleyball distribution
list evolved and when
there was the volleyball
game next
week was changed you'd
write a quick memo and
send it to the volleyball
distribution list then
there was a Chinese food
cooking list and before
long there were more
lists than people and it
was a very very
interesting phenomenon
because I think that
that's exactly what's
going to happen is that
as we start to tie these
things together they're
going to facilitate
communication and
facilitate bringing
people together in the
special interests that
they have and we're
about five years away from
really solving the problems
of hooking these computers
together in the office and
we're about 10 to 15 years
away of solving the
problems of hooking them
together in the home and a
lot of people working on it
but it's a pretty fierce
problem now Apple strategy is
really simple what we want to
do is we want to put an
incredibly great computer in a
book that you can carry around
with you that you can learn how
to use in 20 minutes that's what
we want to do we want to do it
this decade and we really want
to do it with a radio link in
it so you don't have to hook up
to anything you're in
communication with all these
larger databases and other
computers we don't know how to
do that now it's impossible
technically so we had three
options one was to do nothing
and as I mentioned we're all
pretty young and impatient so
that was not a good option the
second one was to put a piece of
garbage computer in a book and
we can do that but our
competitors are doing that and
so we don't need to do that the
the third option was to design
the computer that we want to
put into the book eventually
even though we can't put it
into the book now and right now
it fits in a bread box and it's
$10,000 and it's called Lisa and
it just so turns out that
fortunately there is a giant
office market out there that is
buying these things a lot faster
than we can make them we're sold
out for the next year and we'll
sell over a hundred million
dollars of those things the
first year so fortunately there
is an office marketplace where
enhancing personal productivity
is absolutely worth $10,000 a
person and they're gobbling these
things up and they will pay for
the development of this new
technology the next thing we will
do is we will find a way to put
it in a in a shoebox and sell it
for like $2,500 and that'll be
the next step and finally we'll
find a way to get it in a book
and sell it for under $1,000 and
we will be there within five to
seven years and that's what we're
working pretty singularly on yeah
yeah it is a little crude right okay let me
tell you that what we're planning to do to
sort of be able to provide tools for
graphic design that'll never be our
fort our fort is going to be peaches
people and relative to nothing what we
can give them in the next five years is
a lot and eventually we'll get to the
point where people can create images
that are as good as they could create
any other way but it's going to take
the better part of this decade to be
able to get it down to a price level
that people can afford but we're doing
some things now every computer to date
has used a weird type on the screen as
you know the eyes are just as wide as
the W's they're non-proportionally
spaced fonts we call them you call them
and it's really been impossible to use
multiple fonts on the screen at any
given time matter of fact the fonts have
been just garbage and it's really been
impossible to embed any kind of
graphics with text if you take a look at
Lisa it is totally proportionally spaced
text we have 30 40 fonts on the screen
that come out at approximately 80 dots
prints inch resolution on the screen
approximately up to 300 dots prints
inch resolution on a laser printer and
that's where we are today and what
you're saying is we really want to go to
six seven eight hundred dots per inch
on a laser film printer we're not there
yet but we're solving the problems of
injecting some liberal arts into these
computers that's what we're trying to
do right now let's get proportionally
spaced fonts in there let's get
multiple fonts in there let's get
graphics in there so that we can deal in
pictures and let's get to the point
where three years from now when
somebody there is going to be no
college student three or four years
from now that's ever going to think of
writing a paper without one of these
things just like they will not think of
going to a science class without a
calculator today and where we've got to
get to is where people three four years
from now are using these things they go
wasn't this the way it always was
that's where we're trying to get to
now once we get to there then we can
look at some of the other stuff yeah
yeah I only heard part of the which
part you're talking about the people
having these big databases about your
life or the privacy issue
okay I guess what I see now is an
incredible amount of information but
not a very great ability to distill any
sort of knowledge or wisdom out of that
information we are all bombarded with
information every day and there is so
much information in data banks in
congressional budgets in testimony in
books journal articles being published
every day and our ability to turn all
that information to filter it to what
we're interested in and to turn it into
something useful to us into some
knowledge is very low so I think if
we're really interested in a distributed
society where the ability to
understand things and the ability to
distill information knowledge from
information is possessable by everyone
that the first thing we've got to do is
give tools to people to help them do
that because right now those tools are
centralized you see what I'm saying so I
think the first step towards ensuring
that we don't get a concentration of
something that you don't want is to
distribute that intelligence if you
will that can turn all this this
information into some sort of
knowledge for us so that we can get on
and we can look at congressional to
any congressional testimony that has to
do with gun control any journal
articles published any newspaper
articles published so that I can come
home and on a weekend peruse the weekly
outpouring of information but put a
filter on it because I'm only interested
in gun control and I can find out that
my congressman gave some testimony last
week about gun control that I didn't
agree with so I can get on and write him a
pretty nasty letter and zing it on the
email system and make sure that at
least one of his aides will read it
tomorrow and I think that that
probably is a lot more important than
worrying about these global databases I
don't I don't think that you're going to
find we're moving rapidly into an era of
electronic funds transfer and I think
that's probably the thing that people are
most concerned about right now because
you could keep a history of our
whereabouts and things like that just
based on financial transactions and I
think that's the thing people are most
concerned about right now but I haven't
heard a ton of issues concerning these
giant databases knowing everything about
us that had much substance to them the
thing I'm most concerned with is the
ability to turn all this stuff into
something we can do something about does
that make any sense I didn't get much
sleep last night so I'm a little fuzzy
yeah
ah public service
we we don't do things because we think
they're public services we do them because
we think they ought to be done I guess we
do because we we want to do them we're
doing a few things the first thing
we're doing is there's a situation
that's occurring in schools right now in
that this all started a governor the
former governor of California governor
Brown started this thing called the
California Commission on Industrial
! Innovation in 1980 it turns out you
know we're a we'll do about a billion
dollars this year and we have a
business plan it looks out five years
it's not always accurate but it shows us
the trends shows us the general
directions shows us some of the
pitfalls California's is a oh 22 I
think 300 billion dollar economy GNP
basically is associated with California
and California doesn't have anything
there isn't one scrap of paper there
didn't used to be one scrap of paper
written down so governor Brown got all
these people here and said we got to
figure out where we're going because we
don't have a planned economy but we need
the infrastructure to support it and
infrastructure takes time to build so we
have to at least understand the trends
if you want to be turning out more
engineers next year you can't start this
year you have to have started five years
ago you have to train the teachers etc
etc so what infrastructure we're going to
need to support the growth well the
first thing we looked at was employment
jobs and what we found was that about
44 percent of the new jobs in California
in the 1980s come directly and indirectly
from high technology and we looked at
that we said shit and what are we going
to do to further that and what's going to
hinder that and we there were three
things that came up but the biggest one
was education by a long shot we looked at
the education systems and we are turning
out almost as many welders in California
as we are computer scientists and these
welders are coming out of school and
there ain't any jobs for them and this
is just a minute example of the problem and
so one of the things that Apple decided to
do this is this is not going to make a
giant difference but it could be a
catalyst to get something started as we
decided we wanted to give a computer to
every school in America and there's a
hundred thousand schools in America and
we figured if there was just one there at
least the kids that were interested would
somehow find a way to get to it and
possibly they would start to understand a
little bit about what computers were
maybe integrate them into one or two
classes and so we figured that that would
cost approximately fifty million dollars
and we'd go broke so we went to Congress
and we said look we'll pay ten of this if
you pay forty of it that's ten right out of
our bank account and just to give you a
perspective on it in 1981 Apple made forty
million dollars total after working our
butts off for a year and so we were willing to
spend twenty-five percent of our eighty-one
profits to do that and we got very close to
getting this passed but but Bob Dole in the
Senate killed it because he didn't really
understand it but California being the
bellwether state it was passed the same
law because we pay California tax and so
we call the program the kids can't wait
the kids can't wait for educational
bureaucracy to get around to it the kids
can't wait for their parents to
understand about it and buy them one so
we're just going to get one in there
right now and we are the law got passed in
California we've got there are ten
thousand schools in California the
program was announced sixty days ago and
starting next month we roll out ten
thousand computers one free to every
school in California
and and I guess the important thing though
to restate this isn't going to fundamentally
change the problem but at least it's
going to get one computer in there so
that if there is a student especially in
one of the schools that can't afford
these things which is another thing that
concerns us this computer have computer
have not split at least I'll get exposure
to one so yeah
oh well over half of the gross national
product is contributed by companies and
people that are already in the
information business today and that's true
most of the people that got laid off from
General Motors are never going to go back to
work at General Motors ever ever ever and
unless we retrain them and give them
skills they're going to burn the cities
down and that's one of the biggest
problems facing us right now it's real
easy to talk high-tech it's real hard to
take all these guys that have been putting
fenders on for 15 years you know servicing
computers it's going to be really hard and
we're not paying enough attention to it
right now but we're already in the
information age we're ready there now
most of us manipulate information for
living yeah
right that's right here's a challenge for
you want to just make a great contribution
have fun make zillions of dollars all at the same time
there is there are about 20,000 programs for
the Apple II there's a for the IBM PC which is the
second most popular one now there's about
maybe 2,000 programs that's a lot and you
go to buy one of these things and you
don't know what to buy so you go ask the
computer dealer which one should I buy and
that person doesn't know they're out
selling computers they're not looking at
software and so they give you a bullshit
answer and you buy it and maybe you're
happy and maybe you're not now compare
that to records most people walking into a
record store know exactly what record they
want to buy they don't go up and say what
record should I buy
they know exactly what record they want to
buy because there is the phenomenon of the
radio station a free sampling so that we
make our decisions before we go in to the
distribution center for the records we need
the equivalent in the software business we
need a software radio station person quote
unquote and what's going to happen is is
that I think right now we software is
information and the information is
expressed with a bunch of ones and zeros and
what we do now is we take those ones and
zeros and we encode them magnetically on
this piece of mylar with a bunch of gook on
the surface of it that remembers the ones
and zeros we take it we put it in a
package with a manual we take that we put
it on a truck we ship it to a dealer they
take it out of the truck they put it on the
shelf it sits there for a while costing
the money a customer comes in peruses them
and picks one out takes it home shoves it in
their computer and it translates it back to
electrical impulses of ones and zeros now I mean
that's a pretty long path where we'll be
going is transmitting this stuff
electronically over the phone lines to
where when you want to buy a piece of
software we take our ones and zeros and
you never you ever push a touchtone phone
here do do do do do do do right we'll send
tones over the phone that the computers
will understand and go directly from
computer to computer that's what we'll be
doing once we do that maybe it's possible
to say well we'll give you 30 seconds of
this program for free or we'll give you five
screenshots we'll let you play with it for a
day and if you want to buy it just type in
your visa number and you got it I don't
know how we're going to do it but we need
a radio station yeah
right
okay
there are two things to do to get people and
computers together one thing is to make
computers easier to use and the other
thing is for people to get more and more
familiar with the concepts how many people
here own a Hewlett Packard calculator yeah
not a lot how many people know about them
right do you know the difference between
reverse Polish notation and the way the ti
ones work how the HP one sort of work
backwards right you know about that no
some of you do though right probably
maybe a quarter of you maybe if you had
like tried to explain that to somebody ten
years ago it would have been just like
computers are now and yet in ten years you
know the HP 35 was first introduced in
1972 in ten years people gradually
understand some of these concepts if you
could have given one of these Casio watches
which has got 18 alarms and plays music for
you and everything else to somebody ten years
ago and tried to explain to them how to set the
alarm and stuff like that it wouldn't have been
possible automatic bank telling machines
et cetera et cetera so gradually the the
level of technical literacy is rising the
problem is we're educating people on these
garbage devices you know setting a Casio watch is
really a pain still so even though we have products
like Lisa we are still going to need to educate
people about what computers are and what they do but
where we're trying to get is we're trying to get away from
programming we've got to get away from programming because
people don't want to program computers people want to use
computers and so our strategy right now is let's write some
programs that are generic that sort of will write 90% of the program and you fill in the last 10% of the blanks
a perfect example that's a word processor word processor can be used to write a business letter a report for college exam it can be used to write a correspondence letter to your friend same word processor
we write it once millions of people use it another program you know there's a lot of database programs there's some spreadsheet modeling programs where we do 90% of the work you do the other 10 where we're moving in the future though is programming with graphics connecting the dots if you will
and that's what you'll be seeing more over the next five years what's really exciting though
let me give you a little some of the finest people are going in to software right now
and matter of fact about a year ago I met this little kid in in Chicago who had started this company called Aristotle Software
and he was 13 and he started it with his more mature 14 year old friend and a year ago they were making about $4,000 a week off selling three game programs now let me give you an example how this can work
we have a million Apple twos out there a million and people have paid about $2,000 for them so if they can buy a new program one of these new diskettes for $100 that lets their computer do something totally new that it never could do before that's a good deal
so let's say let's say your girlfriend is in the real estate business right you know a little about computers and she comes home and she's filling out all these crazy forms and going through all these calculations trying to do some creative financing
you go I could write a program for that and you write a program that's not that hard to use and over the next few months you go well can it do this oh sure that's easy can it do this no that's hard you refine this program to where it's really great
and all of a sudden she shows it to all the other people she works with she brings it into the office or she brings them over one day and they go they just go wow I got to have this this is worth $2,000 to me right there just for that one application
okay let's say that you put that program on the market and sell it for $100 well the dealer is going to take $50 of it so you'll see $50 per copy and let's say it cost $25 to make it you're going to make $25 profit per copy
if you can sell that to just 10% of the Apple to owners the first year not including any new Apple to owners because we're shipping almost a million computers a year so it'll double the next year but forget about that even the previous owners of a million you'll sell a hundred thousand copies times $25 profit per copy or two and a half million dollars profit the first year selling just 10% of the people and you can write that program with under $10,000 worth of computer equipment
that's what's happening that's why they're Aristotle softwares and and so you're seeing a flurry of activity there right now yeah
how did you manage to successfully grow so that in terms of all the people and how does that affect the human interaction between the people particularly the ones who are there originally?
okay the actual turnover at Apple has been very very low since inception it's been under 5% since inception actually
okay we do it in a few ways first thing we do is what's happening is the definition of an American corporations evolving and it's evolving in a almost semi-socialistic dimension which is very interesting
a hundred percent of the professionals at Apple own stock in the company a hundred percent everybody owns stock in the company and what that means is these traditional barriers I've never heard the word labor or management mentioned at Apple ever ever in my life we have no unions or anything people say God the electronics industry doesn't have any unions and that's true in one way but in the other way we've got like one of the best unions of everybody going towards the same exact goals and objectives that I've ever seen in my life it's on
sort of an economic scale for sure because it's in everybody's best interest to see the stock go up but more importantly we feel that for some crazy reason we're in the right place at the right time to put something back and what I mean by that is
is most of us didn't make the clothes we're wearing and we didn't cook or grow the food that we eat and we're speaking a language that was developed by other people we use a mathematics that was developed by other people we are constantly taking and the ability to put something back into that pool
of human experiences is extremely neat and I think that everyone knows that in the next 10 years that's we have the chance to really do that and we can look back or and while we're doing it's pretty fun too but I mean we can look back and say God we were a part of that and so everyone is working 18 hours a day right now now on the people side we believe in the phenomenon of great people and what I mean by that is we think there are people that are so good that they can run circles around five pretty good people
okay and those are the kind of people that we want at Apple they're hard to say I mean they're all idiosyncratic but they're the fun people of the world they're the artists of the world and so what we have is sort of a very small company in terms of people for our revenue we are going to cross a billion in sales very shortly with under 5,000 people worldwide and that's phenomenal and I think our feeling
has been that what we want to do is keep the number of people down so that we can spend time with
right that's exactly right the first thing we do is we've always tried to hire people that were much better than we needed for the current job because within six months they'd be fighting to keep up with it second thing though is we've always tried to hire people the reason we hire people is to tell us what to do
and so at Apple when you get hired some people survive and some don't but in general it's hey this is the general thing we think we need done go figure out what we need come back and tell us and tell us how much it's going to cost and go do it
and so we've got an incredible group of entrepreneurs and we're always arguing with each other and things like that but that's just fine and so the 5,000 people we've got most of those people are very independent thinkers and what they really want is they know what to do
what they want is the environment where they don't have to convince 30 other people that it's the right thing to do
does that make any sense? and it's harder as we get older it's harder to spend time with everyone and to pull everyone together but we really make an attempt to do that
and I guess our feeling is that the day that somebody working at Apple decides that they can't make a difference anymore is the day we've lost
you know and we have the standard stuff I mean anyone can come see myself or John Scully or anyone else anytime they want
I mean it might take a day or two to schedule it but we've got people at all levels floating around the you know coming to see us
the other thing we've observed of course is that the oldest and largest organization in the world has only four layers of management
and that's the Catholic Church
and five if you count the highest order I suppose
but
and so we see no reason why we need over four layers of management
and indeed we have usually about three
and it's you know the president we maybe have a division manager and then maybe under that a marketing or engineering manager
and that's really about it
so that's what we're trying to do
well what's really interesting is that people a lot of times
I mean what's been we have good people and and what they've been able to do over the last five years is is pretty awesome
but what's even neater is that what we can do in the next five years
I mean we we are gonna we're in a position now where we're selling a billion dollars of stuff a year
and where we've got one of the most recognized consumer brand names in the country
and so
if we get it together
we can turn out these incredibly great products
with incredibly great advertising
with incredibly great software
and
and so
what we want to do is just get great people to come help us do that
because that's a pretty giant thing to try to do
but that's what we're going for
we started with nothing
so whenever you start with nothing you always can shoot for the moon
you have nothing to lose
and the thing that happens is when you when you when you sort of get something
it's very easy to go into cover your ass mode and then you become conservative and vote for Ronnie
so
what we're trying to do is is to realize the the very amazing time that we're in
and not go into into that mode
and I think Lisa is a reflection of that
I mean we gambled the company on Lisa
if Lisa had bond
Apple would be just one more computer company
and we gambled everything on that
we had no backup to it
everything went into that for three and a half years the best and the brightest at Apple
worked on on this product
now how come they came to Apple to work on this?
we hired these people from other companies
and the reason they came to Apple was because they knew what to do
but the companies they were working for wouldn't take the risk and do it
and we said come to Apple and build this and they said well
who do I have to convince to do that? Nobody just go do it
and we got a collection of the I think some of the finest computer scientists in the world
that just went and did it
and that's why I go to work in the morning is to hang around these type of people they're fun
they play in punk rock bands on the weekends and all sorts of stuff
computer people aren't you read all this computer nerd stuff it's not really true anymore
they're they're really a lot closer to artists than they are to to anything else
they come into work at about I don't know anytime they want but usually about 11 in the morning
12 in the morning play a few rounds of ping pong work really hard they work really hard
but they'll work and generally about 4 we go out and maybe play you know a game of volleyball somewhere
something like that and then in the evening we work and then they'll have dinner
and we go out to a Japanese restaurant for dinner or something come back
and they'll work till about 2 or 3 in the morning
and they go home and wake up at 11 the next morning coming to work
yeah yeah you sure why not
how would we be tied those skilled typists of us to the actual keyboard
once that voice generation really comes into being
what would that do for those of us who have invested thousands already in this keyboard that we have
uh oh
can you teach skiing
voice recognition is about it's going to be the better part of the decade away we can do toy voice recognition now
the problem is it just isn't it isn't just recognizing the voice
when you talk to somebody
it's in understanding language is much harder than understanding voice
we can sort of sort out the words but what do they all mean
and and most language is exceptionally contextually driven
in other words one word means something in this context it means something entirely different in another context
and when you're talking to somebody people interact it's not a one-way communication
it's going yep yep yep yep or and and they they gracefully interact they go in and out of levels of detail
and boy this stuff's hard
so I think you're really looking at uh the better part of a decade before we get close even close to that
I don't know how much time we have I think I'm about to get
thank you very much
I've enjoyed it
so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so
